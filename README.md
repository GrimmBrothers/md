# Flashbots Hackathon summary


Grimm Brothers strategy collective include the a subset of the repositories made by Michael and Bruno during the MEV hackathon.
The main focus of the code is to explain and analyze theoretical strategies and games proposed in the paper \cite.

We include the following repositories:
- In Hamelin repository we explain the strategy and ways of solving it. The strategy and the code are explained (more details in the paper).
- Fake-bidding-strategy we present the code and some ideas of the **red** strtegy presented in the paper. The strategy is summarized in the paper. Is important to remark that this strategy is no longer useful. However, we think that other builders can make use of it.
- Price of MEV we present a simple code to compute the price of MEV of a game played by a given set of address for some blocks.
